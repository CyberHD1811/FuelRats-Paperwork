# DOCUMENTATION:

---

Welcome to the documentation. Before you read furter.... Everything here is just a recommendation and is based on my experiance as a rat.

Every explanation in [] or () will not be in the raw file of each Structure. [] are for the content, the field is made for and () how it should be styled (ONLY RECOMMENDATIONS).

At the top of each explanation is the link to each raw file and at the bottom to an example. Some may have two examples.
