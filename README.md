I've just came up with an idea. Why should i "hide" my Paperwork structure and not share it with everyone? Well, there's no good reason, so i decided to publish it. It may help some of you, for not just typing "Client debriefed", "He went offline" or leaving it completly empty.

Feel free to use it

Every explanation are ONLY recommendations based on my experience with this structure.
If i can't fill out something, i usually use a / as placeholder, but you can ofc leave it empty
