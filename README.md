I've just came up with an idea. Why should i "hide" my Paperwork structure and not share it with everyone? Well, there's no good reason, so i decided to publish it. It may help some of you, for not just typing "Client debriefed", "He went offline" or leaving it completly empty.

Feel free to use it

## Informations:

Please note that with release of the Version 1.0 there only will be minimal personal information about the client. We all want to have our privacy and because we don't ask the clients, we shouldn't use too much information about them.

Every explanations are ONLY recommendations based on my experience with this structure.
If i can't fill out something, i usually use a / as placeholder, but you can ofc leave it empty.


##### Special thanks to [AlphaJarvis](https://github.com/AlphaJarvis) for the help.
