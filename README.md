If you have ever thought about not leaving your paperwork empty, but were too lazy? Then this is the best thing for you. [FuelRats-Paperwork](https://github.com/CyberHD1811/FuelRats-Paperwork) comes with two different versions for succesful/failed rescues and one for invalid/other rescues.

Feel free to use it :).
